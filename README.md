Code and data for *Synergistic information supports modality integration and flexible learning in neural networks solving multiple tasks* https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02996#:~:text=6%20Oct%202022%5D-,Synergistic%20information%20supports%20modality%20integration%20and%20flexible,neural%20networks%20solving%20multiple%20tasks&text=Abstract%3A%20Striking%20progress%20has%20recently,different%20modes%20of%20information%20processing 

Executing each experimental setting script (logic, animalai, neurogym) trains models, tests and stores activations, and computes PID measures on the activations.

Trained models, stored activations, and computed PID measures used in the paper can be found in trained_models, activations, and PID folders, respectively.
